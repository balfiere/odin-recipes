# odin-recipes

In this project I made a webpage with links to recipes. I learned how to use basic git functions from the command line, including cloning a repository, staging changes, writing commit messages, and pushing to the origin. I reviewed how to create a GitHub repository, write an HTML boilerplate, and use some basic HTML elements such as headers, anchors, paragraphs, and lists.
