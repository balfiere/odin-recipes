<h2>Description</h2>

<p>These cookies combine the buttery flavor of shortbread with the herbal flavor of Thai basil. Thai basil, called โหระพา in Thai, has a licorice like taste, which gets further enhanced by the addition of cardamom. Be sure not to confuse this type of basil with กะเพรา or Holy basil, which is more commonly used in Thai cooking than Thai basil, as it has a spicier flavor. This recipe is a variation of Savory Moment's <a href="https://www.savorymomentsblog.com/2018/08/cinnamon-basil-shortbread-cookies.html">Cinnamon Basil Shortbread Cookies</a>.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup vegan butter (I use Country Crock Plant Butter with olive oil)</li>
    <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup lightly packed Thai basil, minced</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp ground cardamom</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp ground cloves</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Cream butter and sugar until fluffy.</li>
    <li>Stir in basil, cardamom, cloves, salt, and vanilla until evenly mixed.</li>
    <li>Gradually fold in flour until just combined.</li>
    <li>Turn the dough onto a couple large sheets of plastic wrap. Try to bring the dough together (it will be crumbly) and use the plastic wrap to form it into a log about 2.5-3 inches in diameter. Wrap the dough tightly and refrigerate overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Slice the log into 1/4 inch wide cookies.</li>
    <li>Bake 10-12 minutes or until the bottom begins to brown.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven. Leave the cookies for a few minutes before moving to a wire rack to finish cooling.</li>
